	abstract = {RNA silencing is a eukaryote-specific phenomenon in which microRNAs and small interfering RNAs degrade messenger RNAs containing a complementary sequence. To this end, these small RNAs need to be loaded onto an Argonaute protein (AGO protein) to form the effector complex referred to as RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC assembly undergoes multiple and sequential steps with the aid of Hsc70/Hsp90 chaperone machinery. The molecular mechanisms for this assembly process remain unclear, despite their significance for the development of gene silencing techniques and RNA interference-based therapeutics. This review dissects the currently available structures of AGO proteins and proposes models and hypotheses for RISC assembly, covering the conformation of unloaded AGO proteins, the chaperone-assisted duplex loading, and the slicer-dependent and slicer-independent duplex separation. The differences in the properties of RISC between prokaryotes and eukaryotes will also be clarified.

	abstract = {The weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) has been used to explore gene expression datasets by constructing biological networks based on the likelihood expression profile among genes. In recent years, WGCNA found application in biomarker discovery studies, including miRNA. Serum samples from 20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were profiled through miRNA 3.0 gene array and miRNAs biomarker candidates were identified through WGCNA. Results were validated by qRT-PCR in 102 HCC serum samples collected at diagnosis. WGCNA identified 16 miRNA modules, nine of them were significantly associated with the clinical characteristics of the patient. The Red module had a significant negative correlation with patients Survival (− 0.59, p = 0.007) and albumin (− 0.52, p = 0.02), and a positive correlation with PCR (0.61, p = 0.004) and alpha-fetoprotein (0.51, p = 0.02). In the red module, 16 circulating miRNAs were significantly associated with patient survival. MiR-3185 and miR-4507 were identified as predictors of patient survival after the validation phase. At diagnosis, high expression of circulating miR-3185 and miR-4507 identifies patients with longer survival (HR 2.02, 95\% CI 1.10–3.73, p = 0.0086, and HR of 1.75, 95\% CI 1.02–3.02, p = 0.037, respectively). Thought a WGCNA we identified miR-3185 and miR-4507 as promising candidate biomarkers predicting a longer survival in HCC patients.},

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence that miRNAs play an important role in the prognosis of HCC. There is currently a lack of acknowledged models that accurately predict patient prognosis. The aim of this study is to create a miRNA-based model to precisely forecast a patient’s prognosis and a miRNA–mRNA network to investigate the function of a targeted mRNA. TCGA miRNA dataset and survival data of HCC patients were downloaded for differential analysis. The outcomes of variance analysis were subjected to univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses and LASSO analysis. We constructed and visualized prognosis-related models and subsequently used violin plots to probe the function of miRNAs in tumor cells. We predicted the target mRNAs added those to the String database, built PPI protein interaction networks, and screened those mRNA using Cytoscape. The hub mRNA was subjected to GO and KEGG analysis to determine its biological role. Six of them were associated with prognosis: hsa-miR-139-3p, hsa-miR-139-5p, hsa-miR-101-3p, hsa-miR-30d-5p, hsa-miR-5003-3p, and hsa-miR-6844. The prognostic model was highly predictive and consistently performs, with the C index exceeding 0.7 after 1, 3, and 5 years. The model estimated significant differences in the Kaplan–Meier plotter and the model could predict patient prognosis independently of clinical indicators. A relatively stable miRNA prognostic model for HCC patients was constructed, and the model was highly accurate in predicting patients with good stability over 5 years. The miRNA–mRNA network was constructed to explore the function of mRNA.},
